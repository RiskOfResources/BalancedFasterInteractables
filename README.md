## Introduction

Have you found yourself unable to give up faster interactables, yet concerned about the advantage they can grant when under pressure? No longer! Now, you can rest easy knowing that they are safely dormant until after the teleporter event has been completed.

- *Printer* and *Scrapper* and *Shrine of Chance* are up to âˆž times faster!
- Only works on stages that have a (charged) teleporter.
- Any time saved gets directly added to the game stopwatch.

Each of these features is configurable, including the speed (from **0** to **100**% time reduction). Use a text editor or [**r2modman**](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman) to edit the file in your `BepInEx/config` folder named `com.riskofresources.fast.interactable.cfg` after launching the game.

While similar to [**FasterInteractableBalancer**](https://thunderstore.io/package/riskofresources/FasterInteractableBalancer), please note that this is a standalone mod and should not be installed alongside [**Exchange_Changes**](https://thunderstore.io/package/Flyingcomputer/Exchange_Changes) or [**Actually_Faster**](https://thunderstore.io/package/Felda/Actually_Faster). While a different implementation is used, credit should be given since they provided a useful reference.
